    <description>Some target fields (e.g. formulas on SObjects) cannot be written on the target object. So, setting Target_Is_Read_Only__c will prevent them from being written. This source version of the flag makes no difference to a straightforward transformation. It is used in combination with a *reverse* transformation - when you make a reverse transformation, this flag is moved to Target_Is_Read_Only__c, allowing a single configuration to be used for round-trips.</description>
