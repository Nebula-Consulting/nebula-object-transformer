    <description>Some target fields (e.g. formulas on SObjects) cannot be written on the target object. So, setting Target_Is_Read_Only__c will prevent them from being written. You may still want to include a target that will be ignored if you are doing a round-trip with a reverse transformation. In that case, this field may end up being used.</description>
